Hi my name is Kyle. I am a CS Major at Washington University in St. Louis.

To run programs, you may open the C++ files up yourself, or you can open the debug files and run the application. 

In this repository you will find:

1. Pokemon calculator: put in your team and the enemy pokemon, and it will calculate the GENERALLY optimal attack. Very general calculations 
for really quick lookup. (No abilities/level/EV/IV/stat boosts/statuses taken into consideration) 

Skills: Wrote a separate program/routine to parse information from the pokemon website in order to gather data. Wrote another program to combine
data together (stats and types where on different tables in different orders). File reading (IO), creating text databases to store information.

2. Wallpaper customizer: customize how your wallpaper shuffles and shifts! Place your wallpapers into folders depending on when you want them
to be shown (daytime or nighttime). More to come! 

Skills: Introduction to Windows API, lots of online reference look-up, timer, localtime, multithreading in C++! (I was originally only familiar
with threading in Java), rand() and seeding
