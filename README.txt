Hi my name is Kyle. I am a CS Major at Washington University in St. Louis.

To run programs, you may open the C++ files up yourself, or you can open the debug files and run the application. 

In these repositories you will find:

1. Pokemon Calculator (C++): put in your team and the enemy pokemon, and it will calculate the GENERALLY optimal attack. Very general calculations 
for really quick lookup. (No abilities/level/EV/IV/stat boosts/statuses taken into consideration) 

Skills: Wrote a separate program/routine to parse information from the pokemon website in order to gather data. Wrote another program to combine
data together (stats and types where on different tables in different orders). File reading (IO), creating text databases to store information.

2. Windows Wallpaper Customizer (C++): customize how your wallpaper shuffles and shifts! Place your wallpapers into folders depending on when you want them
to be shown (daytime or nighttime). More to come! 

Skills: Introduction to Windows API, lots of online reference look-up, timer, localtime, multithreading in C++! (I was originally only familiar
with threading in Java), rand() and seeding 

3. Mealpoint Account Details Program (Javascript): get detailed statistics on your recent purchases, like on average how much are you spending,
what is your favorite place to eat at, etc! 

Skills: First actual program using javascript (self-taught). Webscraping using jQuery. Calculations of variable amounts of information. Simple UI popup.
Understanding of objects and functions in javascript. CSS and HTML utilized for the production as well as for the popup. 

4. League of Legends Voice Timers (Javascript): keep track of your timers hands free! Use voice commands to start timers, and a synthesized voice will alert you 1 minute before they spawn and when they spawn. 

Skills: More experience with javascript. Modular code through use of subroutines and multiple functions. Usage of JS’s synthesized voice option as well as integration of third-party javascript code using annyang’s voice recognition program. Good awareness of how to use voice commands in javascript. 
 
5. Windows Wallpaper Assistant (Java): use an automated system to move your files into day or night folders based on brightness! The perfect companion for the Windows Wallpaper Customizer!

Skills: Java file IO, color and image understanding, file and directory manipulation (cloning, moving files, creating directories, deleting files)

6. Motion Sickness! / Roadtrip Game (Python): using pygame, my first game is here! Dodge the obstacles as you try to last as long as your stomach can handle! Currently in a basic framework state with more propsed changes to be made (as specified in its readme) 

Skills: Python (self-taught)! Pygame libraries and utilities, creating a basic GUI, creating basic graphics (shapes), lists/iteration, timers, sprite creation/animation, game design

7. Pyoko Pyoko Ultra!/ Chick Platformer (Unity/C#): eat up and fatten your chick and get to the end! Currently in a very early stage, but level design is coming up next!

Skills: Unity (self-taught) (camera, self-created physics, player controls -- jumping, crouching, sprinting, moving platforms, animation), C# scripting - class structures, Unity functions  

8. WUSTL Mealpoints App (Obj-C): first time delving into objective c, using webscraping to get all of WUSTL student's mealpoints information into a format that gives useful information
